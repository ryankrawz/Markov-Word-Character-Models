Most importantly, be courteous.  You're in someone else's place and it
simply isn't cool to just open the fridge, grab beer, or start ripping
shots.  Have your most direct connection to the residents get you a
drink.  Don't be rude to any of the residents or their friends.  If
you are asked to leave, do it.

The sense of entitlement to Mod entry needs to stop.  I've heard from
countless people, "I don't remember acting like this when we were
underclassmen," and I don't know if that's true or not, but if we did,
then I wish someone would have told us this information so we wouldn't
have come off as immature and entitled as some Mod patrons I've
encountered.
