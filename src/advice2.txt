Make a good first impression. Wear a nice pair of slacks and a jacket, or a skirt and blouse if you are female, and get to the interview on time. If the interviewer gets a favorable impression of you in the first few minutes of the interview, they will be more likely to overlook minor problems on your resume, such as a bad grade.
