THIS IS REALLY AMAZING. I WANT TO THANK CONGRESSMAN ALAN WEST. HE IS AN AMAZING GUY. I HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER OF HIS. HE IS TOUGH, SMART, AND A REAL PATRIOT. ALSO, RICK SCOTT. HE IS DOING A GOOD JOB. IT IS NOT EASY. HE IS DOING A HELLUVA JOB.  MY SECOND HOME IS RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD IN YOUR COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY KNOWN AS PALM BEACH. I LOVE FLORIDA. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE SOUTH FLORIDA TEA PARTY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS GROUP OF HARD-WORKING, INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. IT IS MY GREAT HONOR, BELIEVE ME. [APPLAUSE]

OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS SINCE I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THIS, I HAVE BEEN ASKED SO MUCH ABOUT THE TEA PARTY BY REPORTERS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT FOLKS. I HAVE COME UP WITH A TRUTHFUL BUT STANDARD ANSWER. THEY ARE GREAT BECAUSE THEY MADE WASHINGTON START THINKING, BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. THEY MADE WASHINGTON START THINKING.

I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. IT IS FANTASTIC. WHEN I WAS ASKED TO DO THIS SPEECH TODAY BY A FRIEND OF MINE, HE SAID IT WOULD BE IN AN AUDITORIUM WITH 250 PEOPLE. WHAT HAPPENED? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WITH ALL OF THE WIND, AT LEAST YOU KNOW IT IS MY REAL HAIR. THE UNITED STATES HAS BECOME THE LAUGHING STOCK AND A WHIPPING POST FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. WE DO NOT LIKE IT.
