Most importantly, be courteous. You're in someone else's place and it simply isn't cool to just open the fridge, grab beer, or start ripping shots. Have your most direct connection to the residents get you a drink. Don't be rude to any of the residents or their friends. If you are asked to leave, do it. The sense of entitlement to Mod entry needs to stop. I've heard from countless people, "I don't remember acting like this when we were underclassmen," and I don't know if that's true or not, but if we did, then I wish someone would have told us this information so we wouldn't have come off as immature and entitled as some Mod patrons I've encountered. I like the Mods. Don't get me wrong. I'm just highly concerned with the manners hitherto exemplified by the patrons of BC's past. I'm now going to continue talking. What you are reading probably doesn't make much contextual sense at this point, and that is because I am purely trying to lengthen this input in order to provide a better baseline for our word based model. Anyway, back to the Mods. Their big and red, and they are often the most sought after housing on campus. But don't let the hype fool you. They are utterly disgusting in their very nature. Just think about how many parties have been thrown in each Mod, and how many times the lovely aromas of vomit have graced their floors.
